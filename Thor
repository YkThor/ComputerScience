    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Why I took Computer Science</span></h5>
    <p>The reason for me taking Computer Science is because Computer science is a field that has the potential to revolutionize the world in countless ways. With continued advancements in technology, it can help tackle some of the biggest challenges facing society today. One of the ways it can do so is by aiding in the development of renewable energy sources. By using data analysis and machine learning, computer science can help create more efficient and sustainable energy systems that will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions.</p>
    <p>Also, computer science can improve healthcare outcomes through better predictive models. With the help of AI algorithms, doctors can identify potential health problems before they become serious. This can lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment, which can save lives. Additionally, with telemedicine, doctors can reach patients in remote areas and provide essential healthcare services to people who might not have access to them otherwise. These are just a few examples of how computer science can make a real difference in people's lives. With continued investment in research and development, the possibilities for using technology to improve the world are endless.</p>

	<p class="w3-text-white">My name is Zachary Ellison, and im a 10th grade at the school Philip o Berry. Im 15 years old and a grade higher than I should be, which initially made school a bit harder. But over time, It became easy and made me more mature for my age. I also love basketball because I have been playing it all my life. I even intend to be on the school team next year. But things haven't been all good for me. During quarantine, I became depressed. I started to eat a lot and became fat in the process. I was also doing terribly in school. It was lonely, very lonely. Then something hit me, and the way I saw things changed completely. I started going to the gym. Go out with friends more. I was trying in school. This turnaround in my life gave me the confidence to think I could overcome anything. That's why I love computer science so much because it has many challenges you have to overcome while doing it. But when you do, it sure does feel good.</p><br>
